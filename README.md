# README

I've quickly come up with the user worflow and ERD diagram

I've chosen simple one to many association to give a user multiple time sheet to create, edit and delete

If give another day: 

* Probably split the way I do check in and check out
* Write controller test

If give another month:

* I would first establish what features are needed with the team
* Separate between nice to haves and must haves
